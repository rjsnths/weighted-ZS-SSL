# weighted-ZS-SSL

This study aims to improve the Reconstruction performance by applying a weight mask to ZS-SSL (Zero-Shot Self-supervised Learning). According to the k-space Deep Learning paper, the performance improves when a weighted filter is applied before passing through the Convolutional Neural Network and the filter is removed after passing through the Network. Therefore, we applied it to the Multi-shot Diffusion-Weighted MRI with ZS-SSL technique and compared PSNR, SSIM, and MSE.
